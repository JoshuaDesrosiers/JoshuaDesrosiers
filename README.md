Hi, I'm Joshua Desrosiers

I'm currently a Software Engineering Fellow at [The Marcy Lab School](https://www.marcylabschool.org/), based in Brooklyn, NY. I enjoy building creative and useful things with code, and have a growing interest in both frontend and backend development. Outside of tech, I spend time drawing, writing, and playing sports.
